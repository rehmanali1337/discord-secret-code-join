1- I'll provide a secret code to a Twitter user
2- when the Twitter user joins the discord the bot will ask him/her what your secret code.
3- Do you have one YES or NO
4- If Yes they will input that secret code and if not they will join the discord anyway, but they won't get the special discord Role.
5-And if the provided secret is right, they'll get the special role  
6-if its wrong, they can't get that special discord role they just have to go through the usual discord/captcha verification
